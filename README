This repository implements the Forward Scattering Dipole model within the 
Mitsuba renderer. More information about the model can be found in the 
SIGGRAPH 2017 paper 'A Forward Scattering Dipole Model from a Functional 
Integral Approximation'
Project page: http://graphics.cs.kuleuven.be/publications/FD17FSDM/


DEPENDENCIES
============

All the usual dependencies of Mitsuba with an additional dependency on GSL 
(the Gnu Scientific Library).


HOW TO BUILD
============

Get the repository:

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/roaldfre/mitsuba

The forward scattering dipole code lives in the fwddip branch.

    $ hg update fwddip

Select a build configuration (currently, only the gcc profile for double 
precision is fully supported)
    
    $ cp build/config-linux-gcc-double.py config.py

Alternatively, if you want spectral rendering (e.g. to render a realistic skin 
material), you can choose a spectral build profile:

    $ cp build/config-linux-gcc-spectral-double.py config.py

Once you have chosen a build profile, start the build process (e.g. assuming 
four cores)

    $ scons -j 4

Add the proper directories to the `$PATH` (e.g. assuming sh/bash shell)

    $ . setpath.sh

You should now be able to run the 'mitsuba' and 'mtsgui' commands (and several 
others).
